			<p>Hot weather camping is a favourite for many people. One reason it’s their favourite type of camping is they know how to do it.
			Hot weather camping isn’t something that should be done on the spur of the moment.
			It takes a lot of planning and preparation. Here are some things that you should know, and things you should do, when camping in hot weather.</p>

			<ul style="  font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:18px; ">
			<li>Understand that sweating is how your body cools off. If you are in an area that is very humid, your skin may have a tough time cooling down because the moisture doesn’t evaporate easily. To encourage evaporation move around and try to camp in the breeziest areas you can find.	<br><br></li>
			<li>You will need to replace the water you lose through perspiration. Drink enough water to keep your urine light coloured or clear. If your urine is dark, your body needs more water. Avoid caffeinated drinks because they take fluids from the body.	<br><br></li>
			<li>Wear light coloured fabrics that breathe. Polyester or nylon works well and dries quickly. Wear a hat.	<br><br></li>
			<li>Wear a waterproof sunscreen and lip balm that is at least SPF 15.	<br><br></li>
			<li>If you can’t find a shady spot to camp, make a canopy out of a trap by tying it between trees.	<br><br></li>
			<li>Make sure you have the correct season rated sleeping bag. You will be miserable if you are in a winter bag. Lighter and cooler bedding works the best in the summertime.	<br><br></li>
			<li>If you are camping in a dry, hot region and you don’t expect rain or high humidity, you can remove the rain fly from the tent.	<br><br></li>
			<li>Sleeping in a tent may be too hot and stuffy. If you sleep on the ground outdoors put a sleeping pad beneath you.	<br><br></li>
			<li>Have two coolers. One should be for drinks only. The other should be the designated food cooler. Having two coolers will keep your food nice and cold as it won’t be affected by the constant opening and closing of the cooler that occurs when people go after drinks.	<br><br></li>
			<li>If you plan to camp for more than two days in the heat, you will need to have finished off the food that you’ve brought that needs to be cold, or you’ll need to go for more ice.	<br><br></li>
			<li>Educate yourself and learn how to recognize and treat health problems that could result from hot weather.	<br><br></li>
