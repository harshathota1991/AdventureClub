			<li> Adventure World Trips are for the people who want great experiences. These are not trips on which individuals
get sent, but trips for which individuals spend the year eager to attend. Each individual’s behaviour and attitude are critical
components for the success of the trip. If a camper’s behaviour or attitude endangers the welfare or experience of the
group, that camper will be sent home.</li><br><br>
			<li>Criminal behaviour of any sort will not be tolerated. This includes the unauthorized use or theft of the property of any
Adventure world program participant or staff member. Also, damage or theft to program vehicles, equipment or any site
visited will lead to expulsion from the program for the remainder of the year.</li><br><br>
			<li> Using or possessing tobacco products, illegal drugs, and/or alcohol are strictly prohibited and will result in the
camper’s immediate removal from the trip.</li><br><br>
			<li> In the event of a camper being removed from a trip due to the above conditions, it is the responsibility of the
individual's to arrange their way back home.</li><br><br>
			<li>Adventure World reserves the right to change the itinerary and activities of a trip due to weather, injuries, illness or
other factors which impact group safety and dynamics.</li><br><br>
			<li> In an effort to keep the integrity of the trip intact, Adventure world will work with individual to arrange removal
from the trip if a camper cannot continue the trip after one day due to illness or injury.</li><br><br>
			<li> Campers are not allowed to bring cell phones or computers (i.e. laptops, iPads, tablets, Kindles etc...) on trips. Cell
phones and computers distract from the group’s experience. If found, these items will be confiscated and returned at the
end of the trip. Trip leaders will be carrying communication devices for emergency use only.</li><br><br>
			<li>Adventure World cannot assume responsibility for any lost, damaged or stolen property, including any electronic
devices.</li><br><br>
			<li> Campers are not permitted to bring any chemicals, illegal items/substances or item(s) that may be construed as a
weapon on any trip (i.e. pocket knives, axes, saws, etc.). Please ask if you have any questions as to what items may be
brought to camp.</li><br><br>
			<li>Campers are continuously supervised. </li><br><br>
			<li>The staff-to-camper ratio is 1:6 with at least two instructors placed in most activities. </li><br><br>
